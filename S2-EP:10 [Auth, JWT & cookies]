->Authentication, JWT tokens & cookies

->Browser and API server Interaction 
  When we hit the API server, a TCP/IP connection made btwn Server and browser and it will be lost when the server replied with response. Stateless communication.

->we should not allow users to get access to /feed api, /user api, /delete api etc without authentication
  and for that we should add authenticated middleware

->what do you mean by login?
  ✅The genearl process, when browser hit the /login api -> It will authenticate the user by credentials and genearte a JWT token and store it in cookie[res.cookie("token",token);] and send along with the response.
  By doing above process, we don't need to use authentication middleware evrytime(validate user), we just need to use token and validate the user.

->There are 3 things in JWT 
  Header  -> Algorithm & Token type
  payload -> we can hide some data inside this payload and we can store some private key also
  signature -> signature
