->Authentication, JWT tokens & cookies

->Browser and API server Interaction 
  When we hit the API server, a TCP/IP connection made btwn Server and browser and it will be lost when the server replied with response. Stateless communication.

->we should not allow users to get access to /feed api, /user api, /delete api etc without authentication
  and for that we should add authenticated middleware

->what do you mean by login?
  âœ…The genearl process, when browser hit the /login api -> It will authenticate the user by credentials and genearte a JWT token and store it in cookie and send along with the response.
  By doing above process, we don't need to use authentication middleware evrytime(validate user), we just need to use token and validate the user.
