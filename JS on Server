->What is server?
  A server is a computer (physical or virtual) or software that provides services, data, or resources to other devices, 
  programs, or users (called clients) over a network. 
  It’s like a 24/7 assistant that listens for requests, processes them, and sends back responses.

->ECMA Script
  ECMA script is a standard for scripting languages like javascript,jscript and actionscript etc
  Standard means following some rules like for declaring variables let a = 65; not a let = 65; 

->V8 - chroome
  spider monkey - Firefox
  chakra - Microsoft Edge
  JavascriptCore - Safari

->V8 Engine
  V8 is a chrome's javascript engine and is written in C++ Lang.
  we can embedd this v8 into any other C++ application.
  It executes any piece of javascript code.

->✅Node.js is C++ application(written using C++) and it has V8 embedeed into it.

->Question: If V8 executes any javascript code, then why do we need node.js ? Just put v8 on the server ?
  1.V8 cannot directly interact with a server's resources(read files,interact with hardware etc) and node.js
    wraps V8 and adds critical features(add some API's) for server-side programming.
  2.Node.js adds what V8 cannot do -
    a)System Interaction 
      Node.js adds APIs to interact with the operating system:
      File System: Read/write files (fs module).
      Networking: Create HTTP servers (http module).
      Processes: Run shell commands (child_process).
    b)Event-Driven Architecture
      Event Loop: Manages asynchronous I/O (e.g., waiting for a database query without blocking the thread).
      Non-Blocking I/O: Delegates slow tasks (like network requests) to the OS, freeing the main thread.
    c)Built-In Modules
      HTTP Server: Create web servers.
      Crypto: Encrypt data.
      Streams: Process large files efficiently.
