->Node.js has an event driven architecture and handles I/O operations asynchronusly.

->Javascript is Synchronus and Single threaded language.But Node js provides some helper functions for 
  doing asynchronus tasks.

->Before learning thread, I need to learn what is "Process" and threads exist in process.

->Process is an instance of running program(running program means OS in a computer)
  It has it's own memory,CPU etc
  eg:
  When you open a chrome web browser in a computer, OS creates a separate process for it.
  and after that you open a notepad in computer, OS creates a separate process for it.
  If one crashes does not disturb other one.(This is main)

->What is thread?
  Thread enable a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently by sharing process's memory and resource.
  Threads exists inside a process and share's process memory and resources
  Each thread works on a different thing and complete concurrent tasks parallely.
