->Node.js has two main components 1.V8 engine & 2.libuv

->What happens when you give your javascript code to V8 engine
  1.Parsing
    a)Lexical analysis - our code is broken down into tokens
    b)Syntax analysis (parsing) - "AST" is generated from the above tokens.
  2.The AST is given to interpreter(Ignition)
    Ignition interpreter converts the AST into byte code for execution
    During this process, if there is any code that is repeatedly used that is given 
    to JIT compliation and it converts into optimized machine code for execution

->Is javascript compiled or interpreted langauge?
  Javascript is both compiled and interpreted language and it uses JIT compilation.
  
->Some time we see unexpected token error this is because AST(Abstract Syntax tree not able to form from token)
