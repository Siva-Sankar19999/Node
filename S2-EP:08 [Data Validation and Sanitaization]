->Validations
  <->User document should not be created when firstname or emailId is not there(we have to provide require in schema level)
  <->Unique type -> There should be one user with one emailID
  <->we can add custom validation at Mongodb schema level using validate function.
     This validate function will not run for update functions by default and we have to turn on using options.
  // validations at schema level
