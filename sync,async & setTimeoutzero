->Generally in node.js, I/O operations are handled in a non-blocking way(async) using 
  libuv. But still we can write using blocking manner using some functions like 
  fs.readFileSync('path',encoding,callback);
  Above code will block the main thread. As it will be handled by v8 js engine.

->There are so many built in modules in node.js

->https, console, crypto etc are core module

->console is core module and it is part of the global namespace
  we can access it without importing it. And we cannot add every core modules
  to global namespace as it pollutes the variables.

->How is the flow of code when we put setTimeout with 0 sec ?
  setTimeout with 0 seconds doesnot execute after 0 sec exactly, It will execute 
  only call stack of main thread is empty. (or)

->callbacks will be pushed into callstack only after the callstack is empty after executing main 
  file(synchronous code or non-blocking code).
