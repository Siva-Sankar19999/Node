->Generally in node.js, I/O operations are handled in a non-blocking way(async) using 
  libuv. But still we can write using blocking manner using some functions like following
  fs.readFileSync('path',encoding,callback);
  Above code will block the main thread. As it will be handled by v8 js engine.
