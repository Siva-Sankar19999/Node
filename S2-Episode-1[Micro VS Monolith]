->Monolith vs Microservice
  <->Dev Speed is more in Microservice and less in Monolith
  <->Scalability
     Tough to scale in monolith
  <->Deployment
     If we have small change in frontend, for that we need to deploy 
     everything in monolith and in microservice we just need to deploy frontend service only.
  <->Tech Stack
     All the different backend services should use same tech stack(Monolith) and in microservice
     we can use different tech stack for different serive like for email->GoLang and Payments->Java
  <->Complexity
     It is more in monolithic service
  <->Fault Isolation
     If there is any issue in any service, only that service will not work properly,
     but where as in monolithic entire application will crash.
