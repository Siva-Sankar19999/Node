->What is Node.js?
  1.Node.js is an open-source, 
      cross-platform & JavaScript runtime environment 
        that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside a web browser (Linux,unix,windows,macos and embedded systems etc).
  2.Built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine.
  3.It enables server-side scripting for building scalable, high-performance network applications.
  4.Node.js uses an event-driven, 
      non-blocking I/O model, 
        making it lightweight and efficient for data-intensive real-time applications.

->Key Features of Node.js?
  1.Asynchronous & Non-Blocking I/O -
    It handles requests asynchronously with blocking for one request. Like input/output operations (e.g., file access, network requests) are initiated 
    without halting the main execution thread. Instead of waiting for a task to finish, the system delegates the work to background processes 
    and responds later via callbacks, promises, or events once the operation completes.
  2.Event Driven Architecture -
