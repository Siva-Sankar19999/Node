->Routes & Request Handlers
  <->Route : Request Method(GET,POST,PUT,PATCH) + path

->app.use("/",(req,res)=>{
         res.send("Hello Home page");
      })
  Above route overides all the routes and all requests will go this one only if used at starting.

->app.use("/test",(req,res)=>{
         res.send("hello from test route");   
       });
  for all the routes that is similar to 
  /test, /test/abc/anything, /test/anything above route will take all the requests.

->Will sequence of routes matters?
  yes. we need to place more specific routes at top

->app.test('/hello',(req,res)=>{
         res.send("Hello World-Z");
      });
 
  app.test('/hello/v1',(req,res)=>{
           res.send("Hello word-HD");
        });
  In above 2 req's, all the request will go to /hello route only.
