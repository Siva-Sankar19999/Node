->Thread pool in libuv

->one cycle of event loop is known as tick

->Is Nodejs single threaded or multithreaded?
  It depends on input. If the input is javascript it is single threaded language and if it 
  involves I/O operations like fs,network it will be multi-threaded as LibUV uses UV_thread Pool(By default four threads)

->By Default there are 4 threads(UV threads) and if we give four async tasks and four will be completed at one time.
  and we can increase or decrease the threads.

->Thread POOL -> fs, crypto, dns lookup & user specified input

->Does API uses thread pool() -> NO
